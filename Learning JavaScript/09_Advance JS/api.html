        /*
        XMLHttpRequest (XHR) objects are used to interact with servers. You can retrieve data from a URL without having to 
        do a full page refresh. This enables a Web page to update just part of a page without disrupting what the
        user is doing.

        for continuous tracking of xl request "onreadystatechange" method is used. 

        -- there are 4 states to track API request
        0 (unsent) 
        1 (opened)
        2 (headers recieved)
        3 (loading / downloading)
        4 (done )

        console.log doesn't run on javascipt engine instead itS a dev tool created in C++ language and runs on combined
        JS + V8 engine or browser engine. 

        - to check code files of console.log read www.github/v8/v8
